# CS321n Assignments Portfolio

Htet Thu Aung
Course: CS231n - Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition
Timeline: March-May 2024

This repository contains my complete solutions to the three major assignments from cs231n course at Standford University, focusing on deep learning and computer vision.

Across these assignments, I progressively built neural networks from scratch, optimized them, extanded them to convolutional architectures, and eventually tackled advanced generative models and self-supervised learning methods.

The journey was designed to simulate a hands-on experience: independently reading documentation, and eventually tackled advanced generative models and self-supervised learning methods.

The journey was designed to simulate a hands-on internship experience: independently reading documentation, debugging, implementing, and deeply understanding modern deep learning techniques through real-world challenges.

### Reflection
Completing these assignments gave me a much deeper understanding of how modern deep learning models are built, trained and applied. I learned not just how models work, but why they succeed or fail in pratical settings.
This portfolio reflects my commitment to mastering core computer vision and deep learning concepts, preparing me for real-world engineering roles in AI and machine learning.
